Version history

1.0-beta-1

    Initial release
    Release date: 2016-12-14
    Intended compatibility: WSUS Offline Update version 10.8 - 10.8.1

1.0-beta-2

    Release date: 2017-01-09
    Intended compatibility: WSUS Offline Update version 10.9

    New features
    - The file client/autostart.ini will be rewritten to show an icon of
      the UpdateInstaller.exe and the built date of the medium. This file
      only works in Windows, and only, if it is in the root directory
      of a mounted ISO image, a real CD/DVD or a disk partition.
    - Introduced a configuration variable "$prefer_seconly" to prefer
      "security-only" update rollups over the full "quality" update
      rollups for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server
      2012, Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2.
      This variable is supposed to be a permanent setting, and it should
      not be changed between different updates. Therefore, there is no
      command-line option for it. The variable is defined and set to
      "disabled" in the script download-updates.bash. It should be
      changed in the file preferences.bash.

    Changed features
    - The files Documentation.odt and Documentation.pdf are renamed to
      Manual.odt and Manual.pdf.

    Removed features
    - The files available-tasks/50-superseded-updates-revised.bash and
      extract-all-bundle-revision-and-update-ids.xsl, which implemented
      a more elaborate method for calculating superseded updates, have
      been removed.

1.0-beta-3

    Release date: 2017-03-30
    Intended compatibility: WSUS Offline Update version 10.9.1 - 10.9.2

    Changes
    - Some more Service Packs are excluded, if the option -includesp is
      not used.

    - The script 40-check-for-self-updates.bash was split into two
      smaller scripts, to handle its tasks separately.

    - An online check for new versions of the Linux scripts is introduced
      with the new script 50-check-sh-version.bash.

    - A new configuration variable "unattended_updates" is introduced to
      install new versions of WSUS Offline Update or the Linux scripts
      automatically.

    - A new file fix-file-permissions.bash was added to make the Linux
      scripts executable again, should they loose their file permissions.

      was simplified.
