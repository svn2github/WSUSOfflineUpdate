OPTIONS
   -includesp
        Include Service Packs

   -includecpp
        Include Visual C++ runtime libraries

   -includedotnet
        Include .NET Frameworks: localized installation files and updates

   -includewddefs
        Virus definition files for Windows Vista and 7. These virus
        definition files are only compatible with the original Windows
        Defender, which was included in Windows Vista and 7.

   -includemsse
        Microsoft Security Essentials: localized installation files and
        virus definition updates. Microsoft Security Essentials is an
        optional installation for Windows Vista and 7.

   -includewddefs8
        Virus definition files for Windows 8 and higher. These are
        the same virus definition updates as for Microsoft Security
        Essentials, and they are downloaded to the same directories,
        but without the localized installers.

        Therefore, "wddefs8" is a subset of "msse", and you should use
        -includemsse instead for the internal lists "all" and "all-win".

COMPATIBILITY
  - The option -includesp can be used with all updates.

  - The options -includecpp and -includedotnet can be used with all
    Windows updates.

  - The options -includewddefs and -includemsse can be used with Windows
    7, Windows Server 2008 and 2008 R2 (w60, w60-x64, w61, w61-x64). These
    options are also used with the internal lists "all" and "all-win".

  - The option -includewddefs8 can be used with Windows 8.1 and 10,
    Windows Server 2012, 2012 R2 and 2016 (w62-x64, w63, w63-x64, w100,
    w100-x64). Use -includemsse instead for the internal lists "all"
    and "all-win".

NOTES
    Windows Vista and higher are multilingual, but WSUS Offline Update
    still needs the correct language settings to get:
    - localized installers for Internet Explorer on Windows 7, Windows
      Server 2008 and 2008 R2
    - language packs for .NET Frameworks, for languages other than English
    - localized installers for Microsoft Security Essentials

    In the Linux download scripts, all needed languages must be given on
    the command-line. For convenience, you can join several languages
    to a comma-separated list, to allow a faster evaluation of Windows
    7, Windows Server 2008 and 2008 R2, .NET Frameworks, and Microsoft
    Security Essentials.

EXAMPLES
    To get updates for Windows 7 with all optional downloads in German
    and English, you could either use:

    ./download-updates.bash w61 deu -includesp -includecpp \
                -includedotnet -includewddefs -includemsse
    ./download-updates.bash w61 enu -includesp -includecpp \
                -includedotnet -includewddefs -includemsse

    or:

    ./download-updates.bash w61 deu,enu -includesp -includecpp \
                -includedotnet -includewddefs -includemsse

    This should get the same updates as the Windows script
    DownloadUpdates.cmd in its default configuration, using the default
    languages German and English.

    To get updates for Windows 8.1 with all optional downloads in French
    and Spanish, you could use:

    ./download-updates.bash w63 fra,esn -includesp -includecpp \
                -includedotnet -includewddefs8

    To get the same results with the Windows script DownloadUpdates.cmd,
    you need to run four additional scripts first:

    RemoveGermanLanguageSupport.cmd
    RemoveEnglishLanguageSupport.cmd
    AddCustomLanguageSupport.cmd fra
    AddCustomLanguageSupport.cmd esn

    Since version 1.1 of the Linux download scripts, updates can also
    be joined to a comma-separated list. To get all updates for Windows
    7 and Windows 8.1, you can use:

    ./download-updates.bash w61,w61-x64,w63,w63-x64 deu,enu -includesp \
                -includecpp -includedotnet -includewddefs -includemsse

    Note, that wddefs8 is a subset of msse, so you don't need to include
    both for such lists.

    Single updates like w61 and w61-x64 can also be combined with the
    internal lists. To get Windows 7 updates and all Office updates,
    you could use:

    ./download-updates.bash w61,w61-x64,all-ofc deu,enu -includesp \
                -includecpp -includedotnet -includewddefs -includemsse

    See the script get-all-updates.bash for more examples. This script
    may also serve as a template for customization.
