Release Notes for Version 1.6

Release date: 2018-05-04
Intended compatibility: WSUS Offline Update Version 11.3 and later

Changes in this version:

- Added support for .NET Framework 4.7.2

- Bug fix: The function create_integrity_database did not create a hashes
  file, if the hashed directory was an alias.

  To prevent the creation of empty hashdeep files, the function
  create_integrity_database counts the number of files in the hashed
  directory. This was done by using "find" and "wc", but find by default
  does not follows aliases. The new implementation lets the bash itself
  calculate the file count.
