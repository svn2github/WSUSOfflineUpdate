# Description
#
#     This script updates the configuration files in the exclude,
#     static, client/exclude and client/static directories. This was
#     formerly known as the "update of static download definitions"
#     (SDD), but it now includes all four directories.
#
#     The update of configuration files can be disabled by setting the
#     variable check_for_self_updates to "disabled".

# The configuration files in the directories exclude, static,
# client/exclude and client/static can be updated individually using a
# mechanism known as the update of static download definitions (SDD).
#
# These updates are always relative to the latest available version
# of WSUS Offline Update. Once a new version of WSUS Offline Update is
# available, the updated files are integrated into the zip archive for
# the new version. Then the individual files are no longer available
# for download.
#
# This seems to imply, that the configuration files should only be
# updated, if the latest available version of WSUS Offline Update
# is installed. This script doesn't need to do an online check for
# new versions, because this has already been done by the script
# 50-check-wsusoffline-version.bash; but it does compare the files
# StaticDownloadLink-this.txt and StaticDownloadLink-recent.txt again:
#
# - If these files are the same, then the latest version is installed.
# - If they are different, then a new version of WSUS Offline Update is
#   available, and the update of the individual configuration files will
#   be postponed.
