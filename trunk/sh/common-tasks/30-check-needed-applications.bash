# Description
#
#     This script checks for needed and recommended applications, but
#     not for optional applications.
#
#     Needed applications: cabextract, hashdeep, wget, xmlstarlet
#
#     Recommended applications: gvfs-trash or trash-put
#
#     Optional applications: aria2, rsync, wine

#
# XMLStarlet
#
# The application XMLStarlet may be installed as /usr/bin/xml or
# /usr/bin/xmlstarlet, dependent on the distribution.
#
# The original documentation at http://xmlstar.sourceforge.net/docs.php
# refers to the binary as "xml". Simply compiling the unmodified upstream
# source code will get the binary "xml". The application name and the
# package name of this project are still set to XMLStarlet and xmlstarlet,
# respectively.
#
# Major distributions, like Debian and Red Hat (RPMForge, RepoForge),
# and subsequently Ubuntu and CentOS, now modify the source code to get
# the binary "xmlstarlet".
#
# In Debian, the binary name was "xmlstarlet" or "xml", depending on
# the architecture, but this was solved in 2006:
#
# Debian Bug report logs - #312932
# wrong binary name (xmlstarlet instead of xml) on i386
# https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=312932
#
# Remaining inconsistencies in the documentation were solved in 2011
# (but not ported back to Debian 7 Wheezy):
#
# Debian Bug report logs - #621755
# xml vs xmlstarlet inconsistencies in documentation
# https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=621755
#
# RepoForge, the successor of RPMForge, uses the name "xmlstarlet"
# for the binary as well. See the package contents at:
#
# http://pkgs.repoforge.org/xmlstarlet/
#
# So, while major Linux distributions use the binary name "xmlstarlet",
# I'm not sure about more archaic distributions, which like to use the
# unmodified upstream source, or the BSDs. Therefore, it may still be
# necessary to check both binary names.
#
# Still, there is only one package to install: xmlstarlet. It was a
# mistake of the old Linux script, to request the installation of two
# packages (one of which never existed).

# Recommended applications: gvfs-trash or trash-put, rsync
#
# It is safer to put outdated files into the trash than to delete them
# directly. Suitable trash handlers are:
#
# - gvfs-trash from package gvfs-bin, for GNOME 3 and other GTK-based
#   desktops environments
# - trash-put from package trash-cli, as a command-line interface to the
#   trash, which is desktop-independent. This should also work without
#   any graphical user interface.
#
# rsync is needed for the script copy-to-target.bash, which was introduced
# in version 1.8.

# Optional applications: Aria2, wine
#
# These applications are not tested by the script, but can be installed
# for some additional functionality.
#
# aria2 can be used as an alternate download utility. Note, that the
# application and package are usually called "aria2", but the binary is
# installed as "/usr/bin/aria2c".
#
# Timestamping works better with Aria2 than with old versions of
# Wget. Wget downloads the file again, whenever the files size changes,
# regardless of the modification date. This is still true for Wget 1.16
# as of Debian 8 stable/Jessie.
#
# Wget 1.17 and higher uses a much improved method for timestamping by
# sending a conditional header If-Modified-Since, just like aria2. Wget
# 1.18 is available in Debian 9 testing/Stretch.
#
# wine is needed to run Sysinternals Sigcheck.exe, but verifying file
# signatures doesn't really work without the necessary root certificates.
