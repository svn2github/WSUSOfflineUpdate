# Description
#
#     During the development of the new Linux scripts, tasks and
#     libraries sometimes need to be replaced or renumbered. Then
#     the first task would be to delete obsolete files of previous
#     versions. Therefore, this new task is inserted as the first file
#     in the directory common-tasks.

# ========== Functions ====================================================

    #
    # The new Linux scripts are included in the main WSUS Offline Update
    # archive in changeset 866 http://trac.wsusoffline.net/changeset/866 ,
    # but then the old scripts in the same directory need to be removed.

    #
    # The directory common-tasks was refactored in version 1.0-beta-3:
    # A new script 10-remove-obsolete-scripts.bash (this one) was added,
    # and the script 40-check-for-self-updates.bash was split into two
    # smaller scripts. The other scripts were renumbered. Thus, all
    # scripts from version 1.0-beta-2 in this directory, if present,
    # need to be removed.

# download scripts. Existing files may be kept and renamed, if they are
# sorted in C-style, and if they use Linux line endings.

# If the exclude lists were created on Windows, they are kept as is at
# this point. They may still be removed later, if a new version of WSUS
# Offline Update or the WSUS catalog file is available.
