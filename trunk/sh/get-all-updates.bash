# Description
#
#     This is an example script to download all updates for the
#     languages German and English. These are the default languages
#     for the Windows script DownloadUpdates.cmd. For the Linux script
#     download-updates.bash, all needed languages must be listed on the
#     command line. Since version 1.0-beta-4, you can combine several
#     languages to a comma-separated list.
#
#     This script should give the same result as the Windows script
#     DownloadUpdates.cmd, if Office x64 support is enabled for German
#     and English by running:
#
#     AddOffice2010x64Support.cmd deu
#     AddOffice2010x64Support.cmd enu
#
#     It may also serve as a template to be customized.


# Stop this script, if one of download runs exits with an error code.
set -o errexit

# Resolving the installation path with GNU readlink is very reliable,
# but it may only work in Linux and FreeBSD. Remove the option -f for
# BSD readlink on Mac OS X. If there are any problems with resolving
# the installation path, change directly to the installation directory
# of this script and run it from there.
cd "$(dirname "$(readlink -f "$0")")"


# Download using internal lists
#
# Using the internal list "all" is a simple way to get all updates for
# all supported Windows and Office versions:

./download-updates.bash all deu,enu -includesp -includecpp -includedotnet -includewddefs -includemsse


# The remaining examples demonstrate, which optional downloads are
# available for each update. They are all commented out, so that they
# won't be called twice.


# Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 and 2008 R2
#
# Setting the language is needed to get localized installers for Internet
# Explorer 9 for Windows Vista, Internet Explorer 11 for Windows 7,
# and for the optional downloads dotnet and msse.

# ./download-updates.bash w60,w60-x64,w61,w61-x64 deu,enu -includesp -includecpp -includedotnet -includewddefs -includemsse


# Windows 8.1 and 10, Windows Server 2012, 2012 R2 and 2016
#
# Updates for Windows 8 to 10 are really global, und they are only
# evaluated once for all specified languages. The language parameters
# deu and enu are still needed for the .Net Framework downloads. Without
# this optional download, one language (any one) would be sufficient.
#
# To be precise, the English installers for .Net Frameworks are always
# downloaded, and they are supplemented by language packs for other
# languages. So, you could actually remove the parameter "enu" here. On
# the other hand, if you like to include other "custom" languages,
# they need to be listed here.

# ./download-updates.bash w62-x64,w63,w63-x64,w100,w100-x64 deu,enu -includesp -includecpp -includedotnet -includewddefs8


# Office 2010 - 2013
#
# o2k10-x64 and o2k13-x64 include both 32-bit and 64-bit downloads,
# just like the Windows script DownloadUpdates.cmd, if 64-bit Office
# support is enabled with the script AddOffice2010x64Support.cmd.

# ./download-updates.bash o2k10-x64,o2k13-x64 deu,enu -includesp


# Office 2016
#
# o2k16-x64 includes both 32-bit and 64-bit downloads. One language
# (any one) is sufficient.

# ./download-updates.bash o2k16-x64 deu -includesp

exit 0
