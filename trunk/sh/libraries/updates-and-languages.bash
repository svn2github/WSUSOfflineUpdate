# Description
#
#     This file defines menus and tables, which are used to create the
#     selection menus for the script update-generator.bash, and to parse
#     the command-line options in the script download-updates.bash.
#
#     Menus and tables basically provide the same information, but in a
#     different format: menus are indexed arrays, as used by the "select"
#     command of the bash, while tables are text variables with multiple
#     lines, which can be parsed by grep.


# ========== Configuration ================================================

# Menus for the script update-generator.bash
#
# Menus are implemented as indexed arrays. They can be used to create
# simple selection dialogs with the bash builtin command "select".
#
# Each array element consists of a name and description. It can be
# split into single fields with "read -r". As usual with "read", the
# last variable receives the remainder of the line. This is used here to
# split the line into two fields, without needing any additional field
# delimiters like commas or semicolons:
#
# read -r update_name   update_description   <<< "${line}"
# read -r language_name language_description <<< "${line}"
# read -r option_name   option_description   <<< "${line}"

# Windows Server 2008, based on Windows Vista, is available in both
# 32-bit and 64-bit versions.
#
# Windows Server 2008 R2, based on Windows 7, "is the first 64-bitâ€“only
# operating system released from Microsoft."

# Tables for the script download-updates.bash
#
# Tables can be searched with grep just like text files. The search
# pattern should be anchored to the beginning of the line and also include
# a trailing space to avoid ambiguities. For example, the first line
# "w60" would be matched with:
#
# grep "^w60 " <<< "${updates_table}"
#
# Each line can then be split into single fields with read -r as
# described above.
