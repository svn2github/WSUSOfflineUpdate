# Description
#
#     This file defines menus and tables for the updates, languages and
#     available options.
#
#     Menus and tables basically provide the same information, but in a
#     different format: menus are indexed arrays, while tables are text
#     variables with multiple lines.
#
#
#     Menus for the script update-generator.bash
#
#     Menus are implemented as indexed arrays. They are used to create
#     simple selection dialogs with the bash builtin command "select".
#
#     Each array element consists of a name and description. It can be
#     split into single fields with "read -r". As usual with "read",
#     the last variable receives the remainder of the line. This is
#     used here to split the line into two fields, without needing any
#     additional field delimiters like commas or semicolons:
#
#     read -r update_name   update_description   <<< "${line}"
#     read -r language_name language_description <<< "${line}"
#     read -r option_name   option_description   <<< "${line}"
#
#
#     Tables for the script download-updates.bash
#
#     Tables can be searched with grep just like text files. To avoid
#     ambiguities, the search pattern should be anchored to the beginning
#     of the line and also include a trailing space. For example, the
#     first line of the updates table would be matched with:
#
#     grep "^w60 " <<< "${updates_table}"
#
#     Each line can then be split into single fields with read -r as
#     described above.
