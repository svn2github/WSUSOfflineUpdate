# Description
#
#     The usage page is shown, if too less or wrong parameters are
#     entered on the command line.
#
#     Optimally, the usage page should be a short overview, which fits in
#     a 80 x 22 window. Then both the previous and the next command prompt
#     can be seen. This allows an easy correction of the command line.
#
#     The complete documentation is in the file documentation/usage.txt.

OPTIONS
   -includesp
        Include Service Packs

   -includecpp
        Include Visual C++ runtime libraries

   -includedotnet
        Include .NET Frameworks: localized installation files and updates

   -includewddefs
        Virus definition files for Windows Vista and 7. These virus
        definition files are only compatible with the original Windows
        Defender, which was included in Windows Vista and 7.

   -includemsse
        Microsoft Security Essentials: localized installation files and
        virus definition updates. Microsoft Security Essentials is an
        optional installation for Windows Vista and 7.

   -includewddefs8
        Virus definition files for Windows 8 and higher. These are
        the same virus definition updates as for Microsoft Security
        Essentials, and they are downloaded to the same directories,
        but without the localized installers.

        Therefore, "wddefs8" is a subset of "msse", and you should use
        -includemsse instead for the internal lists "all" and "all-win".
