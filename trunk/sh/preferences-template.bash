# Description
#
#     This file allows to change some options for the download
#     script. The default values of these options are defined in the
#     scripts download-updates.bash and update-generator.bash, but they
#     should not be edited in these files.
#
#     To make changes, rename the file preferences-template.bash to
#     preferences.bash. This way, the configuration won't be overwritten
#     during updates.


# Set the search order for the supported download utilities.
supported_downloaders="wget aria2c"

# Proxy servers should be entered in the format
#
# [http://][username:password@]server[:port]
#
# If in doubt, refer to the manual pages of wget and aria2c.
#
# Proxy server for unencrypted connections
proxy_server=""
# Proxy server for secure connections (usually the same as above)
secure_proxy_server=""
# A comma-delimited list of domains, which should be connected directly
no_proxy_server=""


# Boolean options
#
# Use "enabled" or "disabled" for the following options.

# Prefer "security-only" update rollups over the full "quality" update
# rollups for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012,
# Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2.
prefer_seconly="disabled"

# All online checks for self updates can be disabled to keep a certain
# installation as is. This may be needed to support old Windows versions
# which are no longer supported by newer versions of WSUS Offline
# Update. Setting the option check_for_self_updates to "disabled"
# prevents the online checks for:
#
# - new versions of WSUS Offline Update
# - new versions of the Linux download scripts
# - updates of the configuration files
check_for_self_updates="enabled"

# By default, new versions of WSUS Offline Update or the Linux download
# scripts are only installed after manual confirmation.
#
# New versions are reported to the user and then the script waits for
# confirmation to install them. This dialog automatically selects "no"
# after 30 seconds, to let the script continue if nobody is watching. This
# also means, that new versions may be missed.
#
# Setting the variable unattended_updates to "enabled" changes this
# behavior: New versions are still reported to the user, but the dialog
# automatically selects "yes" after 30 seconds. This will install all
# updates automatically. This makes the script download-updates.bash
# better suited for automated tasks like cron jobs.
unattended_updates="disabled"

# In recent versions of WSUS Offline Update, the directory
# ../client/win/glb only contains two installers for Silverlight. If you
# don't need Silverlight, you can change the option include_win_glb to
# "disabled".
include_win_glb="enabled"


# Verification of digital file signatures
#
# The verification of digital file signature with wine and Sysinternals
# Sigcheck is disabled by default because of compatibility considerations:
#
# - Current versions of Sigcheck don't run on old CPUs of the Pentium
#   III class.
#
# - The check of digital file signatures is still flawed: Without the
#   necessary Microsoft certificates, Sigcheck can not really validate
#   the signatures; it only detects if a signature is present or not.
#
# Sigcheck version 2.0 and 2.1 still support old CPUs like the Pentium
# III and Athlon XP. Older versions of Sigcheck should not be used,
# because they use different command line options.
#
# Sigcheck version 2.2 and later only run on current CPUs with the SSE2
# instruction set.
#
# On Linux, CPU capabilities may be checked by reading the /proc
# directory:
#
# less /proc/cpuinfo
#
# If the "CPU flags" include sse2, Sigcheck 2.2 can be used without
# problems.
#
# As an additional compatibility test, change to the directory
# wsusoffline/bin and run the command:
#
# wine sigcheck.exe sigcheck.exe
#
# Then Sigcheck should display some information about itself. If this
# works, the verification of digital file signatures may be enabled.
use_file_signature_verification="disabled"

# The creation and verification of an own integrity database with hashdeep
# can be skipped to make the script run faster.
use_integrity_database="enabled"

# The cleanup of client directories can be skipped, if there are
# unexpected problems.
use_cleanup_function="enabled"

# Create more output for debugging. This is only meant for development.
debug="disabled"

# The download and installation of security only update rollups for
# Windows 7, 8, 8.1 and the corresponding server versions depends on
# the configuration files:
#
# - wsusoffline/client/exclude/HideList-seconly.txt
# - wsusoffline/client/static/StaticUpdateIds-w61-seconly.txt
# - wsusoffline/client/static/StaticUpdateIds-w62-seconly.txt
# - wsusoffline/client/static/StaticUpdateIds-w63-seconly.txt
#
# These files should be updated after the official patch day, which
# is the second Tuesday each month. This is done by the maintainer
# of WSUS Offline Update, and new configuration files are downloaded
# automatically.
#
# In the meantime, the function seconly_safety_guard compares the
# modification dates of the configuration files to the official patch
# day. The script will exit and postpone the download, if the files are
# not yet updated. This is done to prevent serious side effects.
#
# Otherwise, WSUS Offline Update will default to download and install the
# latest full quality update rollup. Since these updates are cumulative,
# this will likely spoil an installation, which was meant to get security
# only updates instead.
#
# The configuration files can also be updated manually. This is described
# in the forum at:
#
# - http://forums.wsusoffline.net/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=6897&start=10#p23708
#
# If the configuration files have been updated and verified manually, you
# can change the variable exit_on_configuration_problems to "disabled".
exit_on_configuration_problems="enabled"
