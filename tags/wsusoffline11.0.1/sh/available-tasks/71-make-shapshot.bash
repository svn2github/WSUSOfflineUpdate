# Description
#
#     This task creates a snapshot of the client directory. Files will
#     not be copied but hard-linked. Then the snapshot won't use any disk
#     space, but it may still serve as a backup, if all other copies of
#     the same file are deleted.
#
#     This is similar to the rotating backups described in
#     http://www.mikerubel.org/computers/rsync_snapshots/ .
#
# Usage
#
#     Move this file to the directory download-updates-tasks, to be run
#     after all other tasks.

# ========== Commands =====================================================
