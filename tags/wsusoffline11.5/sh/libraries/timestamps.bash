# Description
#
#     Timestamps are used to prevent a repeated evaluation of the same
#     tasks in adjacent runs of the download script. For example, the
#     directory client/win contains common downloads for all Windows
#     versions. Similarly, the directory client/ofc contains common files
#     for all Office versions. If different Windows or Office versions
#     are downloaded in turn, then the downloads for win and ofc should
#     only be processed once.
#
#     The function "same_day checks, if a task has already been done on
#     the same day.
#
#     In its first implementation, it compared the output of the command
#     "date" in the form "2017-05-09", which is known as ISO 8601 (
#     https://xkcd.com/1179/ ). If the file modification date of the
#     timestamp file and the current date were on the same day, then
#     the same_day function returned true and the download task would
#     be skipped.
#
#     The next implementation in version 1.0-beta-2 calculated the time
#     difference in seconds. The same_day function returned true, if the
#     difference between the file modification date and the current date
#     was less than 24 hours.
#
#     In its current implementation, the same_day function uses three
#     different time intervals for different tasks:
#
#     - The four virus definition files change every two hours. It may
#       be useful, to check these files more often, for example every
#       four hours.
#
#     - Configuration files are checked once daily as before. This
#       includes searching for new versions of WSUS Offline Update and
#       the Linux scripts, and updates of the configuration files for
#       WSUS Offline Update and the WSUS catalog files wsusscn2.cab.
#
#       If these configuration files change, then most or all of
#       the remaining updates will be rescheduled by deleting their
#       timestamp files.
#
#     - The remaining updates all depend on the configuration files. If
#       the configuration files don't change, then these updates cannot
#       change either. These are all updates for Windows, Office, .Net
#       frameworks, and Visual C++ runtime libraries.
#
#       The time interval for these dependent updates is set to a safe
#       value of two days.
#
#       Actually, these updates could be postponed forever. They will
#       be rescheduled immediately, if one of the configuration file
#       changes. This would result in an event-driven evaluation of the
#       updates, rather then recalculating everything everyday.
#
#
#     Timestamps are also used to remember the modification date of
#     single files like the WSUS catalog file wsusscn2.cab and several
#     configuration files of WSUS Offline Update. If these files change,
#     then some or all updates need to be recalculated. Using timestamp
#     files for this comparison is more flexible than reading the file
#     modification dates into variables and comparing the variables.

# ========== Configuration ================================================

# The interval length must take into account the time needed to process
# the task: check the consistency of existing downloads, calculate static
# and dynamic download links, fetch all files (if they don't exist yet),
# and calculate new hashes for the download directory. The timestamp
# will be updated after successfully completing the task.
#
# An initial download, for example of the Windows 10 updates,
# may take several hours, dependent on the speed of the Internet
# connection. Therefore, "four hours" are calculated as 3:20 hours,
# "one day" is now 21 hours, and "two days" are 45 hours. Of course,
# these are only guesses, which can be adjusted as needed below:

interval_length_virus_definitions=12000   # 200x60 seconds
interval_length_configuration_files=75600 # 21x60x60 seconds
interval_length_dependent_files=162000    # 45x60x60 seconds

interval_description_virus_definitions="four hours"
interval_description_configuration_files="one day"
interval_description_dependent_files="two days"

# TODO: Some definitions could be better done with associative arrays,
# but this would require bash 4.x and definitely destroy compatibility
# with Mac OS X.

# ========== Functions ====================================================

# function same_day
#
# Parameters
#
# $1 - The pathname of the timestamp file
# $2 - The time interval in seconds. The interval length for configuration
#      files is used as default, if this parameter is missing
#
# Result codes
#
# 0 - The current task has already been processed in the specified
#     time interval
# 1 - The current task has not been processed in the specified time
#     interval, or the timestamp file does not exist yet.

# In some cases, updating the timestamp for one download should also
# update the timestamp of another, included download:
#
# - Downloads for .Net Framework always include the English installers,
#   because these are the only "full" installers. Installers for other
#   languages are only language packs. Therefore, the timestamp for
#   dotnet-x86-deu should also update the timestamp for dotnet-x86-enu.
# - wddefs8 is msse without the localized installers. Any download for
#   msse should also update the timestamp for wddefs8.
# - Office 32-bit downloads are included in Office 64-bit downloads.
