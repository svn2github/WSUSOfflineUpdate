# Description
#
#     If the new Linux scripts are distributed with the WSUS Offline
#     Update archive, then they don't need any special installation. But
#     zip archives, which are created on Windows, won't preserve Linux
#     file permissions. Therefore, these scripts may not be executable
#     initially.
#
#     This script is meant to correct the missing file permissions.
#
# Usage
#
#     Since this script will also be affected by this problem, you should
#     change to the installation directory sh and run the script as:
#
#     bash fix-file-permissions.bash
#
#     This is only needed once after the first installation. The
#     self-update scripts should take care of adjusting file permissions
#     in the future.
#
#     The main scripts can then be called with:
#
#     ./update-generator.bash
#     ./download-updates.bash <update> <language>

# ========== Functions ====================================================

function fix_file_permissions ()
{
    # Resolving the installation path with GNU readlink is very reliable,
    # but it may only work in Linux and FreeBSD. Remove the option -f for
    # BSD readlink on Mac OS X. If there are problems with resolving the
    # installation path, change directly into the installation directory
    # of this script and run it from there.
    cd "$(dirname "$(readlink -f "$0")")" || exit 1

    # Ensure, that Linux scripts are executable (excluding libraries,
    # tasks and the preferences file, since these files are sourced)
