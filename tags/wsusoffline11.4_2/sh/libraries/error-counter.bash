# Description
#
#     Using an automatic error detection with the shell option errexit
#     or a trap on ERR has some problems:
#
#     If a function returns a result code other than "0", it will be
#     treated like an error in an external command, and the script
#     will immediately exit. The function call could be embedded in
#     a conditional expression, but this doesn't just mask the result
#     code, but also disables the option errexit in the whole function
#     body. Once all functions are embedded in conditional expressions,
#     the shell option errexit will be disabled everywhere.
#
#     This means, that functions should always return 0. The result code
#     can not be used anymore to indicate errors within the function.
#
#     One workaround would be to use a global variable as an error
#     counter. At the start of a function, the current error count can
#     be saved to a local variable. Runtime errors within the function
#     will increment the global counter. At the end of the function, the
#     current error count can be compared to the previously saved error
#     count: If the current count is larger, then some error has occurred.
#
#     Using local variables for the previous state, this also works with
#     nested functions.
#
#     This library provides the global variable and some functions,
#     which use it.
