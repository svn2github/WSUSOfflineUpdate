Release Notes for Version 1.3

Release date: 2018-04-19
Intended compatibility: WSUS Offline Update Version 11.2.2 and later

Changes in this version:

- Wget 1.18 and higher now display a progress bar in the terminal
  window. Earlier versions still use the dot display, which is written
  to the log file.

  In earlier Wget versions, the complete output would either go to the
  terminal window or into a log file. If the output was written to a
  log file, then Wget would always use a dot display for progress.

  In Wget 1.18, we can now have it both ways: a progress bar is displayed
  in the terminal window, while detailed information about the connections
  is still written to the log file. This needs a certain combination
  of options:

  --verbose --append-output="${logfile}" --show-progress
  --progress=bar:noscroll

  The key here is the option --show-progress. The manual page for Wget
  explains:

  --show-progress
    Force wget to display the progress bar in any verbosity.

    [...]

    This option will also force the progress bar to be printed to
    stderr when used alongside the --logfile option.

- The file get-all-updates.bash was revised. All examples now use
  comma-separated lists for the updates.

- A small typo in the file rebuild-integrity-database.bash was corrected.
